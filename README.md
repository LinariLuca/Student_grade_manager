# 🎓 Python Student Grades Manager

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue?logo=python)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This project is a simple **Python exercise** that demonstrates how to use **dictionaries**, **functions**, and **basic control structures** to simulate a student grading system.  
The program supports grade registration, average calculation, and grade-based analysis.
